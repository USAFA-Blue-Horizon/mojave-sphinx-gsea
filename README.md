This code was used to test fire Blue Horizon's first liquid engine. The commit made just before the launch was [2a360510d161af6d3d108bdebddeed3eb2dc54c3](https://github.com/USAFA-Blue-Horizon/mojave-sphinx-gsea/commit/2a360510d161af6d3d108bdebddeed3eb2dc54c3).

Sorry for the lack of documentation. This was written in a matter of days. Perhaps if I have some time I will add some more information and tell the story.
